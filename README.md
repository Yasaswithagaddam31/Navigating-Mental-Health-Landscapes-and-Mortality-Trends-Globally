# Global Mental Health and Physical Health Analysis

Introduction:

This project explores the intricate relationships between global mental health and physical health indicators. By analyzing comorbidity patterns, mortality trends, gender-based differences, and the connection between mental disorders and suicide rates, we aim to uncover valuable insights. Our work is driven by the need for a holistic understanding of mental health, contributing to informed policies and interventions on a global scale.


Objective:

To analyze global mental health data and its relationship with physical health indicators, focusing on:

Comorbidity patterns

Mortality trends

Gender-based differences in mental health

Associations between mental disorders and suicide rates


Dataset:

The dataset includes information on:

Suicide rates

Mortality probability

Prevalence of mental health disorders by year and region

Factors such as rates of specific mental illnesses and the probability of death from particular diseases


Key Facts:

Rows: 2,898

Columns: 11

Target Variable: Suicide


Methodology

1. Data Preparation
   
Outlier Detection and Removal: Box-whisker plots and Z-scores were used to identify and remove outliers to improve data reliability.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
Summary Statistics: Provides an overview of the variability and prevalence of mental health conditions.

Correlation Matrix:

Positive correlations (closer to +1): Indicate variables increase together.

Negative correlations (closer to -1): Indicate an inverse relationship.

Zero correlation: Implies no linear relationship.


3. Trend Analysis:
   
Time trend graphs illustrate changes in suicide rates and related parameters over time, highlighting variations across regions.


4. Visualization:
   
Suicide rates, mental health trends, and correlations were visualized using time-series plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

5. Statistical Modeling:
   
Techniques such as panel regression, unit root tests, and heteroscedasticity tests were employed to build robust models for understanding the data.


Key Findings:

Countries with suicide rates exceeding 20 per 100,000 still require significant intervention despite global average reductions.

Strong correlations exist between specific mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and suicide rates.

Patterns of gender-based differences and comorbidities provide actionable insights for targeted mental health strategies.


Conclusion:

This project highlights the dynamic interplay between mental and physical health. It underscores the importance of addressing mental health holistically to create meaningful interventions and reduce mortality associated with mental disorders.
